	Any subsequent time the NPC will not give you the welcome message. The NPC ProfessorZeitz will output 'Hello! I'm Professor Zeitz.' where as MagicHealer will output 'Hello! I'm a wizard. What can I do for ya?'. NPC's are able to give you items. They will only give you items but not receive them. To trade with the MagicHealer, type 'I don't feel too hot' to receive a magic potion. This will also heal you. By typing 'Get me out of here' the magicHealer will teleport you outside of B13, which does not have any exits allowing you to leave. Go to room B6 to find ProfessorZeitz.  She will accept three separate inputs, 'Can I have an A+?', 'I'm skipping class today','I cheated on a test'. The first input will trigger the Win event and will output 'Here ya go. You Win!'.

	a random room. At this point you have the heaviest item in the dungeon. Find your way to B6 and take the torch. Go 'u' to
	Rotunda Balcony and take the chainsaw. At this point you will not be able to take it. Drop the Bomb and then
